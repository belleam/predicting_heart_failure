# predicting_heart_failure

Predicting the likelihood of heart failure based on several risk factors using the following machine learning models:
* Logistic Regression Model
* Random Forest Model
* Combined Model via meta-classifier
* ANN Model

The dataset is from Davide Chicco & Giuseppe Jurman's study 'Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone' published in BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making (2020). It contains the medical records of 299 heart failure patients.
